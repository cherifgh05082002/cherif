            <p>I wanted to take a moment to tell you how much you mean to me. You are the light of my life, the person who makes my heart sing, and the one I want to spend every moment with. Your love is the most precious gift I have ever received.</p>
            <p>Your smile brightens my darkest days, and your touch brings me comfort like nothing else. I am so grateful for every moment we share together, and I look forward to many more years of happiness and love with you.</p>
            <p>With all my love,</p>
